# Conformance and traceability

Every normative unit of the twelve specs has a stable ID. A section we claim must have a test for each
of its units. `tools/spectrace/spectrace.py` does the bookkeeping. In the dev shell it is `spectrace`;
`nix run .#spectrace -- <command>` also works. By default it reads the pinned specs from the
`logos-lips` flake input.

## Requirement ledger

`conformance/requirements/<PFX>.jsonl` holds one line per unit. The first line records the spec file,
the spec revision and the next free ID.

| Prefix | Spec | Prefix | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| TRN | transport | PKG | package-manager |
| IFC | interface | CAP | capability-authority |
| RUN | runtime | SEC | security-considerations |
| CFG | configuration | BCP | system-bcp |
| LDR | loader | CMT | commitment-model |
| HSH | hash-profile | CDE | cdcddle |

Unit kinds (G117, G118, I6):

| Kind | Unit |
|---|---|
| `kw` | A sentence, list item or table row with an uppercase BCP 14 keyword. A list item with no keyword inherits its keyword lead-in. |
| `lc` | The same, with a lowercase must, shall or should. |
| `cddl` | One CDDL rule, identified by its rule name. |
| `block` | Any other fenced block: vectors, C declarations, examples. |
| `heading` | A section heading. |

IDs survive spec revisions. Matching tries an exact fingerprint first (BLAKE3 over kind and
whitespace-normalized text), then the most similar unit of the same kind in the same section
(similarity ≥ 0.8; a CDDL rule matches the rule of the same name, whatever changed). A unit with no match gets a new ID. A unit that
disappears is kept, marked `retired`, and its ID is never reused.

```bash
spectrace sync --specs ~/repos/logos-lips/docs/logos-core/raw --rev <commit>
```

`sync` rewrites the ledger and prints the added, changed, retired and moved IDs per spec; review
that output against the spec diff. `spectrace check` (a flake check) fails while the ledger does not
match the pinned specs.

## Claims

`conformance/claims/<PFX>.toml` gives each section a status. The longest matching section key wins,
and `default` covers the rest. Section keys are `§4.4`, `App B.1`, or `§1/Heading` for an unnumbered
heading under a numbered one.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `claimed` | Built. Every live `kw`, `lc`, `cddl` and `block` unit in the section must be referenced by a test. |
| `deferred:tier-N` | Not built yet; N is the tier in `docs/SPEC-STATUS.md`. |
| `informative` | Nothing to test (only References and Copyright). |
| `out-of-scope:<why>` | Normative, but not this repository's to implement. |

## Properties not claimed

- Protection between processes of the same OS identity (TRANSPORT §8.2 l.1107-1111): Module Hosts
  run as the daemon's user, so a process running as that user can replace a socket pathname or
  impersonate an endpoint. Deployments that need that protection must run hosts under distinct OS
  identities, which this implementation does not set up (DECISIONS G58).

## Tagging tests

A test covers a unit by carrying its ID in brackets anywhere in the test file, normally in the test
name:

```nim
test "[CDE-0042] map keys sort by encoded bytes":
```

A test of an interim choice for an open item also carries `[IMPL-DECISION Gn]`.

A unit that cannot be tested (pure prose, a rule about other implementations) is covered by an item
in `conformance/inspection/<PFX>.toml` that states why:

```toml
[[item]]
ids = ["HSH-0004"]
reason = "Statement about what a profile document must contain; satisfied by HASH itself."
```

`spectrace gate` (a flake check) fails when a claimed unit has no test or inspection item, when a
test names an unknown or retired ID, or when a claims file has an invalid status.

## Mirrors and pins

`spectrace mirror` checks every file in `spec/mirrors/` against its block in the spec (see
`spec/mirrors.toml`); `--write` refreshes them. `spectrace pins` checks that every value in
`spec/pins.toml` still appears in the section it is pinned from. The tests recompute those values from
the mirrors. `oracle/selftest.py` cross-checks the vectors with an independent implementation.
